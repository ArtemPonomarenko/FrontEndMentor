# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹


[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) helps you to improve your front-end coding skills by building real projects.

To have a closer look at my work: [https://artemponomarenko.github.io/FrontEndMentor/](https://artemponomarenko.github.io/FrontEndMentor/)

The challenge is to build whatever is given and get it looking as close to the design as possible. I can use any tools to help me complete the challenge. I am starting from the low difficulty and work my way up!

In each of the READMEs in each folder, I included the problems I faced, what I learned, and the time it took to complete the challenge. It's a cool way to document my progress and work!

All projects are designed for 2 sizes: 

Monitor: 1440px & Mobile: 375px
